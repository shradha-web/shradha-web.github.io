<p>ng a girl is different for everyone, but there's one thing that unites us all:</br>

Confidence is key, ladies! Whether you step out in stilettos or sneakers,</br> 
or chapstick or lipstick, being a girl is about so much more than just the stereotypes that so often define us.,</p></br>

 <p>hood is about supporting, loving, accepting, and fighting for each other.</br>
